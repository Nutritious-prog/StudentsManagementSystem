## Student Management System

This project is hosted with [AWS](http://springbootreactfullstack-env.eba-8udargqy.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/).

System build in Java and React imitating logistic management system. Application uses AWS database so all records added will maintain on site.

System gives so far two options to add and delete students (edit option is being developed). Fields in from used to add students is protected from unwanted contents so nothing should go pass.

Things to be added in the future:

```
 - Edit user option
 - Manage single student option
 - Sorting options
 - Search bar
 - Some kind of logic on the bar menu
```
